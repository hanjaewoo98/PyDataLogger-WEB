# Key Features

Real-time Data Retrieval: Interact with your vehicle's OBD-II system in real-time, thanks to the Raspberry Pi's Bluetooth interface.

Web Connectivity: The data, when fetched, is readily uploaded to the web server if there's an internet connection. If not, rest assured as the data will be stored locally without any loss.

Instrumental Panel: Experience a dynamic display of your vehicle's metrics through the Raspberry Piâ€™s instrumental panel.

# Behind the Tech
This project leans heavily on FastAPI for building a high-performance web backend with minimal effort. To cater to the front-end and back-end web development using pure Python, the pynecone library is employed. Moreover, SQLAlchemy is integrated to provide a flexible, yet powerful, ORM solution for data storage and manipulation.

# Project Rationale and Conclusion
With soaring popularity in motorsports, many individuals yearn for sophisticated race data loggers, often accompanied by a hefty price tag. PyDataLogger-WEB offers a pocket-friendly alternative, enabling enthusiasts to craft their own data logger, thus bridging the gap between passion and affordability.

Through the course of this project, I've acquired invaluable experience in the nuances and intricacies of IoT-web project development. It stands as a testament to the power and flexibility of Python as a formidable tool in the realm of web-based applications.
